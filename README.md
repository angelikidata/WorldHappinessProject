World Happiness Project:<br />
Track trends and compare global happiness scores (149 countries over a 16-year period).<br />
Use machine learning to identify factors influencing quality of life by country.<br />
➢ Data exploration & cleaning - 1949 entries (Numpy / Pandas)<br />
➢ Data visualization (matplotlib/bokeh)<br />
➢ Predictive modeling (Scikit-Learn)<br />
Models used: Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest<br />
<br />
Conclusions:<br />
➢ GDP per capita, Social Support, and Life Expectancy: main predictors of happiness<br />
➢ Random Forest model is the most accurate<br />
➢ Further research is needed.
